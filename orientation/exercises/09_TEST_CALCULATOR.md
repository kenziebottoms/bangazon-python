# Calculator Unit Tests

Just like you did in JavaScript when you learned about Jasmine, you're going to create a class that test the functionality of a `Calculator` class.

##### [Starter code for test class](assets/calculator.test.py)

> **Note**: The [`setUpClass`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.setUpClass) method below must have the `@classmethod` decorator above it. 

##### [Starter code for calculator class](assets/calculator.py)

## Running the test class

```
python CalcTest.py -v
```
