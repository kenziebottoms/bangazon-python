# Python Tuples

Tuples are like lists, but are immutable. They can't be modified once defined. However, finding values in a tuple is faster than in a list.

## Instructions

- [x] Create a tuple named `zoo` that contains your favorite animals.
- [x] Find one of your animals using the `.index(value)` method on the tuple.
- [x] Determine if an animal is in your tuple by using `for value in tuple`.
- [x] Create a variable for each of the animals in your tuple with this cool feature of Python.

    ```
    # example
    (lizard, fox, mammoth) = zoo
    print(lizard)
    ```

- [x] Convert your tuple into a list.
- [x] Use `extend()` to add three more animals to your zoo.
- [x] Convert the list back into a tuple.
